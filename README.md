# Clockwork Core

Released in 2012, Torchlight 2 was a beautiful game in the legacy of Diablo II.  Now that the game is over 10 years old, many of the modding community sites have begun to disappear.  Their contributions to the game cannot be lost.  This repository is a backup of those files from various sites which I want to preserve.
